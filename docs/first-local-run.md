# The first local run, the morca way (morca 0.3.1)

Kept from the census's former GAPS.md: the census run end to end by morca's scheduler on a laptop.


A fresh lake and `morca` database (the `mojo.repos` schema changed), the
Postgres from conda-forge under `build/pg`, `scripts/env.sh`
(`GHARCHIVE_HOURS=15,17`, `MOJO_HISTORY_MAX_KB=100000`,
`MORCA_SENSE_SECONDS=10`), unauthenticated GitHub (59 requests left), then:

```

The scheduler's log:

`mojo_history` run 3, keyed `Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo`,
`modular/modular`, `mzaks/mojo-flx` and `sdgunaa/Mojonet`: NuMojo 210
commits and 21 migrations (69,563 lines of Mojo now), Mojonet 139 commits
and 6 migrations, mojo-flx 23 commits; 372 commits and 27 migrations in
all, the same as on morca 0.3.0. The UI's mojo_history page shows `reads:
mojo.repos` and "Keys From mojo.repos @ 1204299635680259392, Keys 4,
Done 4"; a key's page answers at `/pipelines/mojo_history/keys/sdgunaa%2FMojonet`.

`morca backfill mojo_repos 2024-06-12` then queued 0 runs, and `morca
backfill --rerun mojo_repos 2024-06-12` queued run 4, which found the
same 23 candidates already settled. From a plain shell with `CONDA_PREFIX`
unset, `./build/gharchive run --partitions 2024-06-12` (one hour, into a
scratch warehouse) wrote 264,870 events of zstd Parquet, and
`./build/console` served `/`, `/versions`, `/repos/<owner>/<name>` and
their JSON from the lake.
