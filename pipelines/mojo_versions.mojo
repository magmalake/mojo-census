"""Records the Mojo version and the dependencies each repository states in its
latest commit, with a version estimated by date.

The mojo_versions pipeline: the Mojo version each repository states at its
HEAD, for the ones whose lock file and manifest name none, and an estimate by
date; and the dependencies its manifests declare at HEAD.

Keyed by the `repo` column of `mojo.repos` like mojo_history, 50 repositories
a run, and a sensor, so each snapshot mojo_repos commits starts runs for the
repositories it adds. A repository that mojo_history hasn't read is read here
all the same (this step clones it without file contents). Run for the
repositories already in the lake by hand:

    orca backfill --rerun mojo_versions @all

which is also how `mojo.repo_deps` and `declared_deps` were filled for the
repositories read before dependencies were (a row of `mojo.repo_versions`
with `declared_deps` null is one of those). New repositories get both from
their first run. Which dependencies are census repositories, and how many
repositories use each, the console works out from the rows when it builds
(`deps.resolve`), so a repository added later is matched without a rerun of
the ones that depend on it.

Each repository goes to a dista task (`read_head_version`: a blobless clone,
the few files at HEAD that can state a version, the date of the last commit
that touched a Mojo file, and the manifests' dependencies). The step then
replaces the repositories' rows of `mojo.repo_deps` and of
`mojo.repo_versions`, one `overwrite` snapshot each, as mojo_retool does: it
keeps the other repositories' rows and adds the new ones, so no row is
duplicated and a rerun gives the same. A repository whose clone fails keeps
the rows it had.
