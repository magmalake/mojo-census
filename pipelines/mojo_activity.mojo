"""Counts each Mojo repository's daily activity and releases from GH Archive,
without calling the GitHub API.

Daily from 2023-01-01 and a sensor on `gharchive.repo_hour`, `gharchive.releases` and `mojo.repos`:
each day gharchive loads starts a run for that day, and so does each
snapshot mojo_repos adds repositories in. A run's one step reads the day's
counts (`gharchive.repo_hour`, which gharchive wrote per repository, actor
and hour while it parsed the events) for every repository in `mojo.repos`, and writes `mojo.activity`
(counts per repository and day) and `mojo.releases` (published releases).

**Repositories found later get their whole history.** A repository isn't
caught up until it is in `mojo.activity_repos`. A run that finds members
of `mojo.repos` that aren't also reads, for them, every other day
`gharchive.repo_hour` has (from the day each was created; a few row
groups of each hour's files, not the day's events), and records them
there; from then on every day's run includes them as members. Each day's
scan is a dista task, so a run that catches up reads its days in parallel.

**Reruns don't duplicate rows.** A run replaces, in the month partitions it
touches, the rows of the (repository, day) pairs it computed and keeps the
others (`replace.replace_files`: one overwrite snapshot a table). The
pipeline runs one run at a time (`max_runs=1`), so no two runs replace the
same partition at once.
