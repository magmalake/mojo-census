"""The gharchive pipeline: each day of GH Archive into `gharchive.events`.

Daily from 2023-01-01, at 03:00 UTC for the day before. A day's step fans
its hours out as dista tasks, at most `GHARCHIVE_PARALLEL` (default 16: 4 instances of 4 worker processes) at a time. A
task streams its hour in on a reader thread while it gunzips and parses
what has arrived, a window at a time, and writes the Parquet data files
into the table itself; it sends back only
their entries, which the step commits to `gharchive.events`, an hour as one
append, in hour order. An hour is one snapshot; a retried step finds the
hours its earlier attempt committed and skips them without downloading again.

The same tasks build the hour's rows of `gharchive.candidates`,
`gharchive.repo_hour` and `gharchive.releases`; the step keeps their files and
commits each of those tables once, at the end, with all the day's hours (one
snapshot a table and day, not an hour). The files of an hour a retry skips
died with the failed attempt, so the retry builds their rows again from
`gharchive.events` (`reindex.index_hour`, as gharchive_index does), and finds
the day's index commits, if the attempt got as far as making them.

A new run of a day that has rows already (`orca backfill --rerun`)
replaces them: its first hour's commit to the events, and the day commit to
each index table, is an `overwrite` that also removes every data file the
day's partition had, so a day's rows always come from one run.

    GHARCHIVE_HOURS=16-17 ./build/gharchive run --partitions 2025-09-15

An hour in flight takes about `eventrows.HOUR_MEMORY_MB` (450 MB on the
busiest hours, 2023-2025) and the run about 300 MB more, so a run's memory is
about 300 + 450 * `GHARCHIVE_PARALLEL` MB (magmalake/mojo-census#37): the
rows of one 50,000-row file at a time, written a 16 MB row group at a time,
and the compressed hour only as far as it is decoded.

`GHARCHIVE_EVENTS=off` (default `on`) keeps the index and drops the events:
each hour's task parses the hour into the three index tables' rows only, as
it does with them on (the same rows, byte for byte: tests/test_eventsoff.mojo),
and nothing is written to `gharchive.events`, which was 97% of the bucket
(about 1.1 GB a day). The day's index commits are as with it on, and so is a
retry's recognition of them (`find_commit` on each index table): with
nothing committed hour by hour, a retry before the index commits downloads
every hour again, and one after them downloads none. A rerun of a day loaded
with the events on leaves that day's events where they are. An hour in
flight then takes `eventrows.HOUR_INDEX_MEMORY_MB` (about 200 MB) rather
than `HOUR_MEMORY_MB`, so a run about 300 + 200 * `GHARCHIVE_PARALLEL` MB. The step still declares `gharchive.events` in `writes=`, so
the pipeline's `registry_hash` (and its lineage) is the same either way: a
declared write the step doesn't make fails nothing.

`GHARCHIVE_HOURS` (`A-B` or `A,B,...`; default all 24) limits the hours, for
trying it locally. `GHARCHIVE_FAIL_AFTER=k` (or `end`, after the index
commits) makes the first attempt of a step fail after it committed k hours of
events (with the events off: after k hours came back), to try a retry
(`scripts/test-daily.sh`).
