"""Builds the candidates, repo_hour and releases tables from stored events, for
days loaded before gharchive built them.

The gharchive_index pipeline fills `gharchive.candidates`,
`gharchive.repo_hour` and `gharchive.releases` for days whose events were
loaded before gharchive wrote them.

A one-off, run by hand (`morca backfill gharchive_index 2026-10-01..2026-11-04`).
For each day, a dista task per hour reads that hour of `gharchive.events` once
and builds the same three tables gharchive builds from the download
(`hourindex.HourIndex`); the step commits an hour as one snapshot of each
table, in order, and a first commit replaces what an earlier run left for the
day, exactly as gharchive does. `gharchive.events` isn't touched. Days with no
events are skipped.
