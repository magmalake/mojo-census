"""Fetches every Mojo repository's issues and pull requests into mojo.issues.

Daily partitions from 2026-11-11, each filled at 08:00 UTC for that day
(`fills=Current`), two hours after mojo_stats so the two don't share an
hour of GitHub's rate limit. For each repository in `mojo.repos` the step
asks GitHub for what changed since the newest `updated_at` it has for it
(`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?state=all&since=…`, which lists pull
requests too), or for everything on its first run: one request per
repository and day, more for a busy one. A day's run merges the changes
into the table and rewrites it (`replace.replace_files`): one row per issue
or pull request, as GitHub had it last.

A first run over all of them is about 1,300 requests and the long histories
(modular/modular) add pages, at most MOJO_ISSUES_MAX_PAGES (100) of 100 a
repository and run; what's left comes the next day. A rate limit is waited
out for at most MOJO_ISSUES_MAX_WAIT seconds (3900) in all.
