"""Reads repositories' git histories again and replaces their rows in the
commits, migrations and tags tables.

A one-off for when `history.read_history` learns something new about the
commits it already read (Bazel as a tooling, 2026-11): keyed by the `repo`
column of `mojo.repos` like mojo_history, 50 a run, and run by hand:

    orca backfill --rerun mojo_retool @all

A repository that mojo_history hasn't read yet is skipped (it will read it
the new way), and one whose clone fails keeps the rows it has. For the rest
the run clones it as mojo_history does (`read_history`) and, in one
`overwrite` snapshot a table, removes the files it read and adds the other
repositories' rows again together with the new ones, so no row is
duplicated: a repository's rows are exactly its new ones. A repository whose
tags came back empty keeps its old tags. The log says the rows of each table
before and after, and a rerun gives the same.
