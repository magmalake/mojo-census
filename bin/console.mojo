"""The console: a flare app over mojo.repos, mojo.commits, mojo.migrations,
mojo.repo_stats, mojo.activity, mojo.releases, mojo.tags, mojo.repo_versions,
mojo.repo_deps and mojo.dep_forks.

    PORT=8080 pixi run ./build/console

Pages: `/` the overview (cards, repos per Mojo version, growth curves),
`/repos` the repos by size and age (`?sort=lines|files|stars|forks|used_by&dir=asc|desc`,
`?version=1.x`, `?active=1y`), `/search?q=` finds repos by name, GitHub topic
or description, then by meaning (the query embedded with mojo_embed's model,
which the console downloads on its first start; CONSOLE_SEMANTIC=0 turns it off), `/migrations` the migrations to each Mojo version over time,
`/how`, `/how/optimizations` and `/how/changelog` how the census is built,
`/repos/<owner>/<name>` one repo. The data pages have JSON at `/api/...`;
`/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` are for
crawlers and language models (`console_ai`). The routes are in `console_routes`.

The repos and the overview are computed and kept (`Cache`), and a background
thread keeps them fresh: every `CONSOLE_REFRESH_SECONDS` (default 1800) it
looks at the tables' current snapshots and, only when one moved or the UTC day
changed, builds a new `Cache` beside the old one and swaps it in. Requests
always read the current one and never wait for a build; until the first build
finishes they get a "warming up" page (503). A new build goes in only when its
data checks pass (`checks`); else the previous one stays, the failing checks
are logged and the footer says so. `/checks` shows the last run.
The per-repo data (commits, migrations, releases, activity) and the
Migrations page are read and rendered at the same time.

The look follows mlake.dev: its warm-ash neutrals, ember accent and lake
links, on the system font stack (no external fonts or scripts).
