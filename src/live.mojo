"""The live poller's GitHub side (#123): which census repos' default branches
moved since the last look, and the commits that moved them.

One GraphQL query asks for the heads of `HEADS_BATCH` repositories at once
(`heads_query`; 1 rate-limit point, a few seconds), so a look at every census
repo is about 26 queries. A repo whose head moved is asked for its latest
`HISTORY_N` commits with their subjects (`history_query`), and the commits
newer than the head seen before are the new ones (`new_since`). A repo seen
for the first time only records its head: its history is mojo_history's.
