"""What gharchive learns from an hour's events while it parses them.

`HourIndex.add` sees every event once and keeps three small summaries, each
written as a table beside `gharchive.events` (same hour task, same snapshot
per hour):

- `gharchive.candidates`: the Mojo candidates `detect.scan_event` finds
  (the rules mojo_repos used to apply to the whole day),
- `gharchive.repo_hour`: counts per (repository, actor, hour) of every
  repository, which is what mojo_activity needs to give a repository found
  later its whole history without reading events again. Only a candidate can
  ever enter `mojo.repos` (`detect.verify` runs on candidates alone), but
  which repository that will be isn't known until a later day, so every
  repository is counted,
- `gharchive.releases`: the published ReleaseEvents.
