"""Committing files to the tables of a day, and replacing the day's earlier
files with the first commit.

`gharchive.events` gets a snapshot an hour (`commit_hour`). Its companions
(`candidates`, `repo_hour`, `releases`) get one snapshot a day from gharchive
(`commit_day`) and one an hour from gharchive_index (`commit_hour`). Each
table counts its own commits (`morca.tables.find_commit`), so a retried step
finds, per table, what it already committed.
