"""A day of `gharchive.repo_hour` as one file.

The hour tasks each write their rows of the table, sorted by (repo, actor,
hour). A dictionary needs many rows to pay for itself, and ~70k-100k rows an
hour do not: the day's 24 files are 35.7 MB, and merged into one file in the
same order, with dictionaries and zstd 9, 20.9 MB (magmalake/mojo-census#28).
The step commits the index tables once a day, so nothing has to look at the
hourly files: this reads the 24 that are not yet committed, writes the one
that replaces them, and deletes them.
