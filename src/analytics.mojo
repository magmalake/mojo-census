"""PostHog product analytics for the console's pages, the way the
magmalake.org website and morca's UI load it.

`posthog_snippet(key, site)` is the `<head>` markup: PostHog's `array.js` and
its API through `/ph` on the page's own origin, a first-party proxy (the
mojourney-ph Worker in magmalake/magmalake.org; the console doesn't serve
it), so ad-blockers keep it. `persistence: 'memory'` sets no cookie and
writes no `localStorage`, so there is nothing to consent to, and `site` is
registered on every event to tell sites apart in a shared PostHog project.
The console passes `POSTHOG_KEY` from its environment.
